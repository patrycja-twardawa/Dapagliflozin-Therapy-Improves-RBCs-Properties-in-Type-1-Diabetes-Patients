# Dapagliflozin-Therapy-Improves-RBCs-Properties-in-Type-1-Diabetes-Patients

Data included in this repository is related to the study of erythrocyte stiffness in type 1 diabetes patients and serves as a supplementary resource for the paper entitled "Monthly dapagliflozin therapy improves the nanomechanical properties of red blood cells in patients with type 1 diabetes" (Twardawa et al., 2024). In the uploaded OPJU file (data analyzed in OriginPro 2022b software), data for counted elastic moduli (E [Pa]) has been included for anonymized patient labels, with workbook sheet names representing the figures in which the data is visually presented.

Patrycja Twardawa (1) and Marta Targosz-Korecka (2) are the guarantors of this work and, as such, had full access to all the data in the study and take responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.

This work was supported by the Polish National Center for Research and Development under the Solidarity with Scientists Program, contract number SzN/I/47/IMDoE/2022.
